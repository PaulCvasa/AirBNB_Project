 AirBNB Simulator

 AirBNB took off years ago as the first service to allow homeowners to rent a room or entire apartment via the Internet.
 On this platform we differentiate two roles: the Homeowner and the Renter. A Homeowner can have one or multiple spaces 
 for rent, under different categories: Shared Room, Private Room, or Whole Place. Each space must define basic properties 
 like the City, address, number of beds, private or shared bathroom, provided toiletries, smoking allowed, etc. You can consult
 the official AirBNB website and select a few. Additionally, each space is associated with a calendar, used for managing reservations.
 In order to ease the Renter's interaction you should have functions that search through the different spaces and filter
 them based on city, address, number of rooms, beds, etc. 
 Requirements:
 (1p) – Create a Class Diagram modelling the entities.
 (3p) – Implement the entities described above as Java Classes, Interfaces or Enumerations. 
 (1p) – Present the average utilization of the Platform. The average should be calculated per Homeowner per week, depending on the number of spaces it has rented out of the total possible slots.
 (1p) – Compute the total revenue of the platform. The platform obtains revenue as a commission (%) of each reservation.
 (2p) – The Platform should save its state incrementally to a file, such that in case of a crash the reservations and spaces descriptions are reloaded from the last known state.
 (1p) – Use command line arguments to determine if the platform must be started from scratch or if the user wants to reload from a previously saved state file.
 (1p) – Document your code
